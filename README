Open the project in any IDE or editor.

We used Intelij so these instrcutions will be related to that.

It should be able to run as is.

If there are import errors for ANTLR related imports.

Download "Complete ANTLR 4.13.1 JAVA binaries jar" from the website
https://www.antlr.org/download.html

Go to File -> Project Structure -> Libraries -> Add the ANTLR binaries jar you just downloaded -> Apply and select Okay

These should solve the imports and then you can run the project.

You can run the project through StaticBugDectector and inputs are example.c, example1.c and etc in the src folder.
Change this line to run a new example in StaticBugDectector:
CharStream codeCharStream = CharStreams.fromFileName("./src/example.c");

Null Pointer Errors:
example.c
example3.c

No Errors:
example2.c
example4.c
